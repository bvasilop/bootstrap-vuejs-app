# Demonstration of Small Edits

This project is meant to go alongside the [Bootstrapping an App Project](https://shawnr.gitbooks.io/practical-javascript-2-building-applications/bootstrap-new-app/project-bootstrap-an-app.html) from Practical JavaScript 2: Building Webapps. This project demonstrates all of the edits described on the project page from the book.

Please refer to the book for more documentation about what is going on in this repository.
